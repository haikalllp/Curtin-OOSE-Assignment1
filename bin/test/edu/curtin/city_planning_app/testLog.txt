--- Comparison with grid -7x7New.txt ---
Test 1 (Row 4, Column 3):
flat,height-limit=20,heritage=stone

# The terrain is flat, the height limit is 20, and the heritage is stone. Entered 2 floors, it is below the height limit, and there are no constraints on the foundation or material. Therefore, the structure can be built.

Test 2 (Row 3, Column 4):
flat,heritage=stone,height-limit=13

# The terrain is flat, with a height limit of 13, and heritage is stone. Entered 5 floors, which is within the height limit, and the foundation is stilts, which is compatible with flat terrain. in the program, the structure should be able to be built.

Test 3 (Row 6, Column 2):
swampy,flood-risk=68.211328,heritage=wood

# The terrain is swampy, selected a slab foundation. program should identify that slab foundations cannot be built on swampy terrain.
